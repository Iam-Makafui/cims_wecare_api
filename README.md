    Welfare Payment (Single & Bulk): Facilitating individual or bulk payments efficiently ensures timely support to beneficiaries while streamlining the payment process.

    Case Management: Capturing detailed information about each case, including member details, issued aid, and dates, allows for personalized support and accurate tracking of welfare activities.

    Reporting and Analytics: Essential for insights into the welfare program's performance, helping in decision-making, resource allocation, and identifying trends or areas needing attention.

    Chatbot: A user-friendly interface to access and retrieve welfare-related data from the database, enhancing accessibility and easing information retrieval for users.

    SMS Notifications: Timely notifications can be crucial for both beneficiaries and staff, ensuring important updates or reminders are received promptly.

    Expenses Entry and Tracking: Maintaining records of expenses incurred allows for transparent financial tracking, aiding in budgeting and compliance with auditing standards.
